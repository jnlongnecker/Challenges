        <value>Hello, my name is Jared! I&apos;m a Salesforce trainer with 2 years of experience training the material. My favorite topic to teach and work with is Lightning Web Components! They&apos;re a great deal of fun to use and I even use the open-source version to make a website as a side project.</value>
